# block_breaker

A Flutter game inspired by the classical game Block Breaker. Made as a part of my Bachelor's thesis about multiplatform game development using Flutter.

## Disclaimer

This game is not meant to be a full game, but rather a proof of concept that Flutter can be used to create games. The game is not yet finished and is missing some features and bug fixes.
